# Ray-Space Constrained Multichannel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Audio Source Separation

This repository contains the implementation of the Ray-Space Constrained Multichannel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (MNMF) method for audio source separation. The proposed approach introduces a novel model that considers ray-space-transformed signals in the context of non-negative matrix factorization.
